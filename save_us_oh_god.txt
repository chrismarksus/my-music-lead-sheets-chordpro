{title:Save Us Oh God}
{subtitle:Isaiah 56:7}
[G]   We con[C]fess [G] the sins of our [C]nation
[G]   And Lord we are [C]guilty [Am7]of a prayerless [D]life
[G]   We've turned a[C]way [G] our hearts from Your [C]laws
[G]   And have taken for [C]granted [Am7]Your unchanging [D]grace

Turn away this curse from our country
We say that we've robbed You and our storehouses are bare
Open wide the floodgates of heaven
Rebuke the devourer so we may not be destroyed

[C]   You said that if we'd [G]humble ourselves [C] and begin to [G]pray
[C]   You would heal our [G]barren land and [Am7]cleanse us with Your [D]rain

[C]   Don't pass us [G]by, [C] let this be the gener[G]ation Lord
[C]   That lifts up Your [G]name to all the [D]world
[C]   Save us oh [G]God, [C] save a people for Your[G]self, oh Lord
[C]   Let the fear of the [G]Lord be their [D]stan[G]dard[Am7]         [G]
[C]   Save us oh [G]God, [C] cleanse us from our un[G]falthfulness
[C]   Let the place where we [G]live be called a [D]house of [C]prayer
