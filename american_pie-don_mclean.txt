A [G]long [D/F#]long [Em]time ago [Am]I can still re[C]member
how that [Em]music used to make me [D*]smile And [G]I knew [D/F#]if I had [Em]my chance
that [Am]I could make those [C]people dance and [Em]maybe they'd be [C]happy for a [D*]while.
[Em]But February [Am]made me shiver [Em]With every paper [Am]I'd deliver      
[C]Bad news [G/B]on the [Am]doorstep I c[C]ouldn't take one [D]more step
I [G]can't re[D/F#]member if I [Em]cried When I [C]read about his [D]widowed bride
But [G]something [D/F#]touched me deep inside The [C]day the [D]Music [G]Died     [C]    [G]      So

{start_of_chorus}
[G]bye [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie Drove my [G]chevy to the [C]levy But the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em]this'll be the day that I [A]die [Em]this'll be the day that I [D]die. (embellish last D) (built tempo)
{end_of_chorus}

[G]Did you write the [Am]book of love And do [C]you have faith in [Am]God above?
[Em]  If the Bible [D][Dsus4]tells you so.  Do [G]you be[D/F#]lieve in [Em]Rock 'n Roll?
Can [Am]music save your [C]mortal soul? And [Em]can you teach me [A]how to dance [D][Dsus2]real slow? 
Well, I [Em]know that you're in [D]love with him 'cause I [Em]saw you dancin' [D]in the gym        (play stops)
You [C]both kicked [G/B]off your [Am]shoes Man, I [C]dig those rythmny [D]blues
I was a [G]lonely [D/F#]teenage [Em]broncin' buck With a [Am]pink carnation and a [C]pickup truck.
But [G]I knew [D/F#]I was [Em]out of luck The [C]day the [D]music [G]died [C]    [G]  I started singin'   
{comment:(Chorus)}

[G]Now for ten years we've been [Am]on our own And [C]moss grows fat on a [Am]rollin' stone
[Em]  But that's not how it [D] [Dsus4]used to be When the [G]jester [D/F#]sang for the [Em]King and Queen
In a [Am]coat he borrowed [C]from James Dean And a [Em]voice that [A]came from [D][Dsus2]you and me
Oh, and [Em]while the King was [D]looking down The [Em]jester stole his [D]thorny crown        (play stops)
The [C]courtroom [G/B]was ad[Am]journed No [C]verdict was re[D]turned
And while [G]Lennon [D]read a [Em]book of Marx The [Am]court kept practice [C]in the park
And [G]we sang [D/F#]dirges [Em]in the dark The [C]day the [D]Music [G]Died.[C]    [G]   We were singing
{comment:(Chorus)}


I [G]met a girl who sang the [Am]blues And I [C]asked her for some [Am]happy news
But [Em]she just smiled and turned [D][Dsus4] away I [G]went down to the sacred [D/F#]store
Where I'd [Em]heard the music [Am]years before But the [Em]man there said the [A]music woudn't [D][Dsus2]play
And in the [Em]streets the children [D]screamed The [Em]lovers cried, and the poets [D]dreamed     (play stops)
[C]But not a [G/B]word was [Am]spoken The [C]Church bells all were [D]broken
And [G]three men I [D]admire most The [Em]Father, [Am]Son and the [C]Holy Ghost
They [G]caught the [D/F#]last train [Em]for the coast The [C]Day the [D]Music [G]Died.[C]    [G]     And they were singing
