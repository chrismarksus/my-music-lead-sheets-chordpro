[C] It's our confession, Lord, that [F]we are [C]weak
[F]So very w[C]eak, but [G7sus]you are [C]strong
And though we've nothing, Lord, to [F]lay at your [C]feet
We [F]come to your [C]feet and say, [G7sus]"help us alo[C]ng" [G7sus][C]

[Dm7] A broken heart and a [C/E]contrite spirit
[F] You have yet to de[G7sus]ny [G]
[Dm7] Your heart of mercy beats with [C/E]love's strong current
[F] Let the river flow
By your [G7sus]Spirit now, [G]Lord we cry

{soc}
[C] "Let your mercies fall from he[C/E]aven
[F] Sweet mercies flow from he[F/A]aven
[G7sus] New mercies for tod[G7sus/B]ay
[C]Shower them down Lord, as we pray"[G7sus]
