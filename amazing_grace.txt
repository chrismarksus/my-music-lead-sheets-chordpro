{t:Amazing Grace}
Am[F]azing [F/A]grace, how swe[Bb]et the so[F]und
That saved a [Dm]wretch like me[F/C][C]
I [F]once was [F/A]lost but no[Bb]w am fo[F]und
Was [Dm]blind but no[F/C]w I[C] see[Bb][F]

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun
