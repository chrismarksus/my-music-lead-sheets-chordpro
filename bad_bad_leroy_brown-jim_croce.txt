{t:Bad, Bad Leroy Brown}
{st:Jim Croce}

{c:Verse:1}
[D7]Well the S[G]outh side of Chicago,
Is the ba[A7]ddest part of town,
And if you [B7]go down there, You better j[C]ust beware,
Of a m[D7]an named Leroy B[G]rown.[D7]

{c:Verse:2}
Now L[G]eroy more than trouble,
You see he st[A7]and 'bout six foot four,
All the do[B7]wntown ladies just call him Tr[C]eetop Lover,
All the m[D7]en just call him S[G]ir.[D7]

{c:Chorus}
{soc}
And it's b[G]ad, bad Leroy Brown,
The b[A7]addest man in the whole damn town,
B[B7]adder than old King K[C]ong,
And m[D7]eaner than a junkyard d[G]og.[D7]
{eoc}

{c:Verse:3}
Now Le[G]roy he a gambler, And he l[A7]ike his fancy clothes,
And he l[B7]ike to wave his d[C]iamond rings,
In front of ev[D7]erybody's no[G]se,[D7]
He got a c[G]ustom Continental, He got an E[A7]ldorado too,
He got a [B7]32 gun in his po[C]cket for fun,
He got a r[D7]azor in his s[G]hoe.[D7]

{c:REPEAT CHORUS}

{c:Verse:4}
Well Fr[G]iday bout a week ago, L[A7]eroy shootin' dice,
And at the e[B7]dge of the bar, Sat a g[C]irl named Doris,
And o[D7]oh that girl looked n[G]ice.[D7]

{c:Verse:5
Well he c[G]ast his eyes upon her, And the tr[A7]ouble soon began,
And L[B7]eroy Brown learned a le[C]sson 'Bout messin',
with the w[D7]ife of a jealous m[G]an.[D7]

{c:REPEAT CHORUS}

{c:Verse:6}
Well the t[G]wo men, they took to fightin',
And when they p[A7]ulled them from the floor,
L[B7]eroy looked like a ji[C]gsaw puzzle,
With a co[D7]uple of pieces go[G]ne.
