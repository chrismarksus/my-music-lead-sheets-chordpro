{c:Intro} 
[G] [D4] [Em7] [D] [C]

[G]There goes my old girlfriend, there's a[D]nother diamond ring
And, uh, [Em]all those late night promi[D]ses I [C]guess they don't mean a thing
So [G]baby, what's the story? Did y[D]ou find another man?
Is it [Em]easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
[D]When you [C]don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade a[D]way.
I [G]used to feel your fire 
But now it's [Em]cold inside
[D]And you're [C]back on the street like you didn't miss a beat, yeah

{c:Chorus}
{soc}
[A#]Tell me what it takes to let you [F]go
[A#]Tell me how the pain's supposed to [F]go
[A#]Tell me how it [A+]is that you can [Dm]sleep in the [Dm/C]night
Without t[Dm/B]hinking you lost everything that was good in 
your life to the toss of the dice?[A#]
Tell me what it [C#]takes to let you go[F].
{eoc}

Yeah
Girl, before I met you I was F.I.N.E. Fine
but your love made me a prisoner, yeah my heart's been doing time
You spent me up like money, then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

{c:Repeat Chorus}
{gc:Guitar Solo}

[C]Tell me that you're happy that you're on your [G]own Yeah, yeah, [A#]yeah
Tell me that it's better when you're all [F]alone
[Fm]Tell me that your body doesn't m[D#]iss my[C#] touch
Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that m[G#]uch
Tell me you ain't dyin' when you're cryin' fo[C]r me

{c:Repeat Chorus}

[A#]Tell me what it takes to let you go
[A#]Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice?
Tell me who's to blame for thinkin' twic[F]e
No no no no [A#]'cause I don't wanna [C#]burn in paradi[F]se

O[Dm]h [A#]Let go, let go, let go,
let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go,
let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I don't wanna burn, I don't wanna burn
