{gc:DWB: (Between to D and Am7, try Dsus4->D->D9->D, pulling-off the high E from the

3rd fret to 2nd fret to open E, then a quick punch on the 2nd fret again)}

{c:VERSE 3}
Lullabies, look in your eyes,
Run around the same old town.
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past.
But I'm all alone at last.
Rolling home to you.

Old man look at my life, I'm a lot like you were  {gc:x2 (intro chords)}

{gc:FM7 is x00560, and you repeatedly hammer-on the third (G) string (0h5)}
{gc:The mention of Dsus4 is to indicate that you should fiddle around with the }
{gc:high E string, between D, Dsus4 and D9.}

{gc:(DWB: I made the corrections he notes in the next paragraph, and fixed up the ending)}

{gc:Just looking at the file right now, i wonder if the line: D F C G  D F C G}
{gc:(or D F C G x2 )  is correct - strikes me it should end in F. hmmm}
{gc:If you make any additions or corrections - let me know of them!}
