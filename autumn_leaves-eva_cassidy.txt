{c:Intro}
[Em7]      
{c:Verse 1}
[Em7]The falling [Am7]leaves   [D7]   drift by my [GM7]window  [CM7]
The falling [Am6]leaves [B7]   of red and gold   [Em]

{c:Verse 2}
I see your [Am7]lips,  [D7]    the summer  [GM7]kisses   [CM7]
The sunburnt [Am6]hands [B7]  I used to hold    [Em]

{c:Chorus}
{soc}
Since you [B7]went away The days  grow [Em]long
And soon I'll [Am7]hear  [D]old winter's [G]song
But I [Am6]miss  you most of [B7]all my [Em7]darling
When[Am7] Au[Am6]tumn [B7]leaves start to [Em]fall
{gc:instrumental same chords as verse x2}
{eoc}

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all
my darling,
When Autumn leaves start to fall
