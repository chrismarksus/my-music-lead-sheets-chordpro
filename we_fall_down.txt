[E]We fall down
We [B]lay our [C#m]crowns
At the [A]feet of [F#m7]Jesus
The [E]greatness of [B]mercy and [C#m]love
At the [A]feet of [B]Jesus

And [E/G#]we cry, [A]"Holy, [E/G#]Holy, [F#m7]Holy"
And [E/G#]we cry, [A]"Holy, [E/G#]Holy, [F#m7]Holy"
And [C#m]we [B]cry, [A]"Holy, [C#m]Holy, [B9]Holy"
Is the Lamb[E][D/E][E][D]
