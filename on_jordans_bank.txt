{t:On Jordan's Bank}
On Jordan's bank the Baptist's cry
Announces that the Lord is nigh
Awake and hearken, for he brings
Glad tidings of the King of kings

Then cleansed be every breast from sin
Make straight the way of God within
And let each heart prepare a home
Where such a mighty guest may come

For thou art our salvation, Lord
Our refuge, and our great reward
Without thy grace we waste away
Like flowers that wither and decay

All praise eternal Son, to thee
Whose advent doth thy people free
Whom with the Father we adore
And Holy Ghost for evermore

{c:Charles Coffin, 1736}
