{Title:Did You Feel the Mountains}
[D] Did you feel the mountains tremble?
[G/B] Did you hear the oceans roar?
[Em] When the people rose to sing of
[G] Jesus Christ the [A7sus]risen one [D][A7sus][D][A7sus]

Did you feel the people tremble?
Did you hear the singers roar?
When the lost began to sing of 
Jesus Christ the saving one

And we can [G/B]see that God you're mo[D2]ving
A mighty [G/B]river through the na[D2]tions
And young and [G/B]old will turn to Je[D2]sus
[Em] Fling wide you heavenly gates
[G] Prepare the way of the [A7sus]risen Lord [D2][A7sus][D][A7sus]

{soc}
[D]Open up the doors and [Bm]let the music play
[Em]Let the streets resound with si[D2]nging [A7sus]
[D]Songs that bring your hope 
And [Bm]songs that bring your joy
[Em]Dancers who dance upon inju[D2]stice [A7sus][D2]
{eoc}

Do you feel the darkness tremble
When all the saints join in one song
And all the streams flow as one river
To wash away our brokenness

And here we see that God you're moving
A time of jubilee is coming
And young and old return to Jesus
Fling wide you heavenly gates
Prepare the way of the risen Lord
