{st:Creedence Clearwater Revival}

{c:VERSE 1}
[D]I see a [A]bad [G]moon a[D]risin'
I see t[A]roubles [G]on the w[D]ay
I see e[A]arthqu[G]akes and l[D]ightning
I see  b[A]ad t[G]imes to[D]day

{c:CHORUS}
{soc}
Well d[G]on't go round tonite, it's [D]bound to take your life
Th[A]ere's a [G]bad moon on the [D]rise
{eoc}

{c:VERSE 2}
I hear hurricanes a blowin'
I know the end is coming soon
I feel rivers over flowing
I hear the voice of rage & ruin

{c:REPEAT CHORUS}

{c:VERSE 3}
Well don't go round tonite, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite well prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

{c:REPEAT CHORUS}

{c:VERSE 4}
Don't go round tonite, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Don't go round tonite, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
