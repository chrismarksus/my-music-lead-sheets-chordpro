{t:Zombie }
{st:The Cranberries}

[Em]Another [C]head hangs lowly, [G]Child is slowly ta[D]ken
[Em]And the violence [C]caused such silence, [G]who are we mis[D]taken
But you [Em]see, it's not me, it's not [C]my family
In your [G]head, in your head, they are [D]fighting

{soc}
With their [Em]tanks, and their bombs, and their [C]bombs, and their guns
In your [G]head, in your head they are cr[Bm]yin'

In your [Em]head, In your [C]head Zomb[G]ie, Zombie, Zombi[Bm]e, ie, ie
What's in your [Em]head in your h[C]ead, Zomb[G]ie, Zombie, Zombi[Bm]e, ie, ie, ie
[Em]Ou, ou, ou, o[C]u, ou, ou, ou [G]ooooh aaah la la la [D]
{eoc}

[Em]Another [C]mother's breakin' [G]heart is taking o[D]ver
[Em]When the violence [C]causes silence [G]we must be mis[D]taken
It's the [Em]same old theme since [C]1916, in your [G]head, in your head they're still figh[D]tin'
