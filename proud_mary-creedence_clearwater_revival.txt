[G] [E][D][C]      [D][A]

{c:Verse 1}
[A]Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleep
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

{c:Chorus}
{soc}
The b[E]ig wheel keeps on turnin',
Pro[F#m]ud Mary keeps on burnin'
Ro[A]llin', rollin', rollin' on the river
{eoc}

[G] [E]        [G] [E]
[G] [E][D][C]      [D][A]

{c:Verse 2}
[A]Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of pain in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Till I hitched a ride on the Riverboat Queen

{c:Repeat Chorus}

{c:Verse 3}
[A]If you come down to the river
Bet your gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry, cause you have no money
The people on the river are happy to give

{c:Repeat Chorus}
