{c:Intro}
[Cadd9]                                    
{c:Verse 1}
[Cadd9]It's Christmas [Fmaj7]time,   [G]    there's no need to [Cadd9]be afraid
At Christmas [Fmaj7]time,  we [G]let in light and we [Cadd9]banish shade
And in our [Fmaj7]world of [G]plenty
We can [Cadd9]spread a smile of j[Fmaj7]oy
Throw your [Dm7]arms around the wo[G]rld at Christmas ti[Cadd9]me

{c:Verse 2}
But say a p[Fmaj7]rayer,  [G]  and pray for the [Cadd9]other ones[C7]
At Christmas [Fmaj7]time it's ha[G]rd, but when you're h[Cadd9]aving fun
There's a [Fmaj7]world outside your wi[G]ndow
And it's a [Cadd9]world of dread and fe[Fmaj7]ar
And the [Dm7]only water fl[G]owing
Is the [Cadd9]bitter sting of t[Fmaj7]ears
And the [Dm7]Christmas bells that rin[G]g there
Are the [Cadd9]clanging chimes of do[Fmaj7]om
Well ton[Dm7]ight thank God it's th[G]em instead of yo[Cadd9]u

{c:Verse 3}
There [Fmaj7]won't be snow in Africa this[G] Christmas time[Cadd9]        [C7]
The [Fmaj7]greatest gift they'll [G]get this year is [Cadd9]life
Where [Fmaj7]nothing ever [G]grows, no [Cadd9]rain or river f[Fmaj7]lows
[Dm7]Do they know it's [G]Christmas time at all?

{c:Instrumental break x2}

{c:Bridge:}
{sob}
[Am]Here's to you raise a [G]glass for everyone
[Am]Here's to them u[G]nderneath that burning sun
[Fmaj7]Do they know it's [G]Christmas time at all?
{eob}

{c:Outro x2}
[Cadd9]   [Fmaj7]   [C]     [Fmaj7]   [C]   [Dm7]   [G]

[Cadd9]Feed  [Fmaj7]the   [C]wo[Fmaj7]rld -  [C]let them [Dm7]know it's [G]Christmas time (x4)

[Cadd9]
