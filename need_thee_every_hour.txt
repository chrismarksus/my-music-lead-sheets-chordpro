{t:I Need Thee Every Hour}
{st:Robert Lowry and Annie Hawks}

{c:Verse 1}
I n[G]eed Thee ev'ry h[G/B]our, [C]most grac[G]ious Lord.
No t[D]ender voice like Thin[A]e can p[D]eace afford.

{c:Verse 2}
I need Thee ev'ry hour, stay Thou nearby,
Temptations lose their pow'r when Thou art nigh.

{c:Chorus}
{soc}
I [Em]need Thee, Oh[D] I need Thee, every [G]hour I need Thee;
[G/B]O bl[C]ess me no[G]w, my Savi[C]or, I[D] co[G]me to Thee
{eoc}

{c:Verse 3}
I need Thee ev'ry hour, in joy or pain.
Come quickly and abide or life is vain.

{c:Verse 4}
I need Thee ev'ry hour, teach me Thy will
And Thy rich promises in me fulfill.
