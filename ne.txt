{t:Undone}
[E]I[A] want to [E/G#]know if it would be all right[A]
To [E/G#]be with you tonight[A]
I am un[E/B]done[A][E/G][A/F#][E]
[E]Wait, don't go[A]
Don't [E/G#]let my heart turn to stone[A]
[E/G#]Fear, it has no home[A]
When you are [E/B]near[A][E/G][A/F#][E]

[F#m]Yes I [A]need you now more than [F#m]then
I need[A] you to let your...
[E]Rain[A] [E/G#]down on me [A]
[E]Fall[A] [E/G#]all around me [A]

Wait, don't hide
Please shelter me in your side
From there my strength is derived
I am done
So, is that the way the story goes?
In your arms I know
It's all right

Yes I need you now more than then
I need you to let your...
Rain down on me
Fall all around me

Let it ra[E]in,[A] let it ra[E]in[A]
Let it ra[E]in,[A] let it ra[E]in[A]
[E]I can hear the [A]sound of rain coming [E/G#]down (echo)
[E]I can hear the [A]sound of rain coming [E/G#]down (echo)
