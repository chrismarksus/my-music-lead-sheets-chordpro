{c:VERSE 1}
[D]I caught you knocking at my [D/C]cellar door,                    
[D/B]I love you, baby, can I ha[D/Bb]ve some more?                    
[C]Ooo[F]ooo the damage [Esus4]done.     [E]

{c:VERSE 2}
I hit the city and I lost my band,
I watched the needle take another man,
Gone, gone, the damage done.

{c:VERSE 3}
I sing the song because I love the man,
I know that some of you don't understand;
milk-blood to keep from runnin' out.

{c:VERSE 4}
I've seen The Needle And The Damage Done,
A little part of it in everyone,
But every junkie's like a settin' sun.
