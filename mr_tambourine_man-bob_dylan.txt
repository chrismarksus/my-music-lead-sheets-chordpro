[G]Hey! Mr. [A]Tambourine Man, [D]play a song for [G]me,
I'm not [D]sleepy and there [G]is no place 
I'm [A]going to. [Asus4]      [A]
[G]Hey! Mr. [A]Tambourine Man, [D]play a song for [G]me,
In the [D]jingle jangle [G]morning 
I'll come [A]followin' [D]you.[Dsus4]      [D]  [Dsus2]      [D]
{eoc}

Though I k[G]now that evenin's e[A]mpire has r[D]eturned into [G]sand,
Va[D]nished from my h[G]and,
Left me bl[D]indly here to st[G]and but still 
not sl[A]eeping[Asus4].     [A]
My we[D]ariness am[G]azes me, I'm br[D]anded on my f[G]eet,
I h[D]ave no one to m[G]eet
And the a[D]ncient empty st[G]reet's too dead for 
dr[A]eaming[Asus4].     [A]

{c:Chorus}

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wanderin'.
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
I promise to go under it.

{c:Chorus}

Though you might hear laughin', spinnin', swingin' madly across the sun,
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
Seein' that he's chasing.

{c:Chorus}

{c:Harmonica part 1}

Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

{c:Chorus}

{c:Harmonica part 2}
