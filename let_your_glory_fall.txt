[C] Fath[D]er of [D/F#]crea[G]tion[G2/B]
[C] Unfold your [D]sov'rei[D/F#]gn plan [G][G2/B]
[C] Raise up a [D]chosen genera[Em]tion[Bm/D]

All of creation is longing for Your unveiling of power
Would You release Your anointing, oh God let this be the hour

{soc}
Let Your [G]glory fall [D/G] in this room[C/E][G/D]
Let it go[C] forth from here [G/B] to the [Dsus]nations [D]
Let your [G]fragrance rest [D/G] in this place[C/E][G/D]
As we [Am7]gather to [Dsus]seek [D]your [G]face [G2/B]

Ruler of the nations, the world has yet to see
The full release of Your promise, the church in victory
Turn to us Lord, and touch us, make us strong in Your might
Overcome our weakness, that we could stand up and fight

[F] Let Your will[C] be don[G]e (let your will [C/E]be done)
[F] Let us see[C] on eart[G]h (let us see [C/E]on earth)
[F] The glory [C]of Your [Dsus]Son[D][E7sus (add 9)]
