[G]You are my st[D]rength when I am w[Em]eak
You are the [G]treasure that I [C]seek
You are my [G]all [D]in [G]all[D]
[G]Seeking You [D]as a precious [Em]jewel
Lord to give [G]up, I'd be a [C]fool
You are my [G]all [D]in [G]all[D]

[G]Taking my [D]sin, my cross, my [Em]shame
Rising [G]again, I bless Your [C]name
You are my [G]all [D]in [G]all[D]
[G]When I fall [D]down, You pick me [Em]up
When I am [G]dry, You fill my [C]cup
You are my [G]all [D]in [G]all[D]
