{t:When I Survey the Wondrous Cross}
[Fsus]When I sur[F]vey the [Gm9]wondrous [F/A]cross,
On which the [Fsus/Bb]Prince [F/A]of glo - [Fsus/Bb]ry  [C]died,
[Fsus]My richest [F]gain I [Gm9]count but [F/A]loss,
And pour con[Fsus/Bb]tempt on [C]all my [Fsus]pride.

Forbit it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down; 
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns comprise so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.
