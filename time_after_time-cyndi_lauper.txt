{c:VERSE 1}
[F6]Lying[C] in my b[F6]ed I [C]hear the c[F6]lock t[C]ick,
and t[F6]hink of y[C]ou
c[F6]aught [C]up in [F6]circl[C]es c[F6]onfusi[C]on--
[F6]is nothing [C]new
[F6]Flashb[G]ack--[Em]warm [F6]nights--
[F6]almost [G]left [Em]behind
[F6]suitc[G]ases of[Em] memories[F6],
[F6]time [G]after--

{c:VERSE 2}
sometimes you picture me--
I'm walking too far ahead
you're calling to me, I can't hear
what you've said--
Then you say--go slow--
I fall behind--
the second hand unwinds

{c:CHORUS}
{soc}
if you're l[G]ost you can look--and you w[Am7]ill find me  [F6]
[F]time [G]after [C]time
if you f[G]all I will catch you--I'll [Am7]be waiting
[F]time a[G]fter t[C]ime
{eoc}

{c:VERSE 3}
After my picture fades and darkness has
turned to gray
watching through windows--you're wondering
if I'm OK
secrets stolen from deep inside
the drum beats out of time--
