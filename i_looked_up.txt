And I saw my Lord a-dying

On a tree

I looked up
And I saw my Lord a-rising
I looked up
And I saw my Lord a-rising
From the grave

{start_of_chorus}
Hallelujah, He is risen
Hallelujah, He's alive
Hallelujah, He is risen
Hallelujah, He's alive
{end_of_chorus}

One day I'll look up
And I'm gonna see my Lord a-coming
Yes I'll, I'll look up
And I'm gonna see my Lord a-coming
In the clouds
