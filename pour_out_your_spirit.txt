Let the [G]battle cry re[Dm7/G]sound
Let the [G]heaven's trumpet [Dm7/G]sound
See the [G]Kingdom come [Dm7/G]
In glory the [G]King he comes[Dm7/G][C/G]
Let the [G]holy banners r[Dm7/G]aise
Let the [G]army shout in prais[Dm7/G]e
See the [G]Kingdom come [Dm7/G]
In glory the [G]King he comes[Dm7/G][C/G]

[Eb]Coming forth from Your [F]throne
The heavens [G]tremb[Dm7/G]le[G][Dm7/G]
[Eb]Rising mighty in [F]power
Great is Your [Dsus]name, oh [D]Lord
