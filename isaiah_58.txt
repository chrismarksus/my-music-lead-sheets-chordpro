{t:Isaiah 58}
[Ab]Loose[Eb/G] the [Bb]chains
[Ab]Break[Eb/G] the [Bb]yoke
[Ab]Clothe[Eb/G] the [Bb]poor
[Ab]Share[Eb/G] your [Bb]food

[Bb]Then your [F/A]light will [Ab9]shine in the [Eb]dark[Bb/D]ness[Cm7]
And your [F]night will be[Gm]come like the [F/A]day
[Bb]Then your [F/A]righteous[Ab9]ness will go be[Eb]fore [Bb/D]you[Cm7]
And the [F]glory of the [Gm]Lord will be your [Ab]rearguard [Eb/G] 

And you will [Bb]call upon His name and He will [Ab]answer [Eb/G]
And [Bb]strengthen your frame
Like a [Ab]garden [Eb/G]
In a [Bb]sun-scorched land
You'll be a [Ab]well-spring  [Eb/G]
Whose [Bb]waters never fail and when you [Cm7]cry for help
The [Bb/D]Lord will say [Eb9]"Here I am"

[Cm7]We will re[Bb/D]build the ancient [Eb9]ruins
[Cm7]We will re[Bb/D]pair the broken [Eb9]walls
[Cm7]The King of [Bb/D]Glory will come [Eb9]in
[Eb]The Lord Al[F]mighty will come [Gm11]in

We will rebuild the ancient ruins
	(Lift up your heads O ye gates)
We will repair the broken walls
	(Be lifted up you ancient doors)
The King of Glory will come in
	(Who is this King?)
The Lord Almighty will come in

And we will call upon Your name and You will answer
And strengthen our frame
Like a garden 
In a sun-scorched land we'll be a well-spring 
Whose waters never fail and when we cry for help
You will say "Here I am"

Spend yourself
Find your joy
Ride the heights
Feast on God
