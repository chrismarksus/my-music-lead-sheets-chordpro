[D]Jesus [A]Christ, I thi[G]nk upon Your sacrific[D]e
[G]You became no[D/F#]thing, po[G]ured out to death[A]
[D]Many ti[A]mes I've wo[G]ndered at Your gift [D]of life
And [G]I'm in that pl[A]ace once again[D]
[G]I'm in that pl[A]ace once again[D]

{soc}
[D/F#]And once again I [G]look upon the [D/F#]cross where You died[A]
I'm h[D]umbled by Your mercy and I'm br[G]oken inside[A]
[Bm7]Once again I th[G]ank You
[D/F#]Once again I p[A]our out my life[G][Asus][A]
{eoc}

[D]Now You [A]are exalted[G] to the highest [D]place
[G]King of [D]the heavens, where [G]one day I'll [A]bow
[D]But for [A]now, I ma[G]rvel at Your sa[D]ving grace
And [G]I'm full of pr[A]aise once again[D]
[G]I'm full of pra[A]ise once again[D]

[G]Thank You for the cr[A]oss
[D/F#]Thank You for the cr[D]oss
[G]Thank You for the cr[A]oss, my Fr[D]iend
