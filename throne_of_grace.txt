Oh my [Em]Lo - [D] - r[G]d,  [C]you are so[D] kind [Dsus][D]
Morning to mo[C]rning, day to da[D]y
You re[C]veal your righteous [D]ways[Dsus][D]

It's your [G]kindness that l[C]eads to re[D]pentence
It's your [Em]blood that [D]brings for[C]giveness
It's your [G]mercy that leads me here
To y[C]our throne of [D]grace [Dsus][D]

In your [G]kindness I [C]find re[D]pentence
In your [Em]blood I [D]find for[C]giveness
In your [G]mercy I find myself
At y[C]our throne of[D] grace [Dsus][D]
Your throne of gr[Em7]ace[Cmaj7][D][Em7]
