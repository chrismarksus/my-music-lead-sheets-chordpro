{t:O Little Town Of Bethlehem}
O little town of Bethlehem how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wond'ring love
O morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently the wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of his heaven
No ear may hear his coming, but in this world of sin,
Where meek souls wil receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in

O holy child of Bethlehem, descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in, be born in us today
We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel!
