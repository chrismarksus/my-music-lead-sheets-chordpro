NOTES

 Verse:
 The verse chords are downstrokes on the first two beats of each
 measure.

 Refrain:
 The first 10 measures are picked (through the third D chord), then
 it starts strumming leading up to the G which is played like the
 verse.  The G D Cadd9 D sequence is then strummed.

 Also in the refrain: on the CD I have, they almost seem to let the
 Em chord ring out over the D, so you could probably just play the
 Em chord for the first measure and let it ring until the C chord
 of actually playing the D.

 Bridge:
 The bridge is picked like the refrain, one chord per measure.  Note
 that it is only 14 measures long, however.

 Ending:
 The 'I want them back' section is picked
