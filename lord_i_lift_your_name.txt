{title:Lord I Lift Your Name on High}
[G]Lord, I [C]lift your name on [D]high[C]
[G]Lord, I [C]love to sing your [D]praises[C]
[G]I'm so [C]glad you're in my [D]life[C]
[G]I'm so [C]glad you came to [D]save us[C]

[G]You came from [C]heaven to [D]earth
To [C]show the way[G]
From the [C]earth to the [D]cross
My [C]debt to [G]pay
From the [C]cross to the [D]grave
From the [Em]grave to the [Am]sky
Lord, I [D]lift your name on [G]high
