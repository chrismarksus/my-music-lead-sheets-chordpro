{t:Therefore We Lift Our Hearts In Praise}
[G]Therefore we [Am/G]lift our hearts in [D7/G]praise
[Em]Sing to the [D]living God who [Bm7]saves
For [C]grace [Am7]poured [Bm]out [Em]for [C]you [D7]and [C/E]me[D/F#]

There for ev'ryone to see
There on the hill at Calvary
Jesus died for you and me

For our sad and broken race
He arose with life and grace
And reigns on high for you and me

There for such great pain and cost
The Spirit came at Pentecost
And comes in pow'r for you and me

Therefore we lift our hearts in praise
Sing to the living God who saves
For [C]grace [Am7]poured [Bm]out [Em]for [C]you [D7]and [C/G]me[G]
