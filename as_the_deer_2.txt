{t:As The Deer 2}

{c:VERSE 1}
[C]As the de[Em]er panteth [Am]for the[Am/G] water
So my s[F]oul longeth [G]after [C]Thee.
[C]You al[Em]one are my he[Am]art's [Am/G]desire
And I l[F]ong to w[G]orship T[C]hee.

{c:VERSE 2}
[Am]You alone are my str[F]ength, my sh[C]ield,
To[F] You alone may m[Dm7]y spirit[E] yield.
Y[C]ou al[Em]one are my he[Am]art's [Am/G]desire,
And I[F] long t[G]o worship[C] Thee.


{c:VERSE 3}
You're my friend and you are my brother
Even though You are a King.
I love You more than any other,
So much more than anything.

{c:VERSE 4}
I want You more than gold or silver
Only You can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy giver
And the apple of my eye.
