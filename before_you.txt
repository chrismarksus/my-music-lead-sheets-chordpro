{t:Before You}
[Gm]     [Eb]     [Bb]     [F]
Is there an[Gm]y forgiv[Eb]eness
F[Bb]or the things I've do[F]ne
Is there [Gm]pardon for sinn[Eb]ers,
[Bb]I know that I'm on[F]e
Befo[Gm]re you[Eb]      [Bb]      [F]
Befo[Gm]re you[Eb]      [Bb]      [F]

Would you take this heart of foulness
And make it clean again
Would you pour on me your mercy
As I confess my sin
Before you, before you

Pl[Eb]ace your Holy Sp[Bb]irit in m[F]e
Le[Eb]ad me in the wa[Bb]ys everla[F]sting[Gm]
I lo[Eb]ng to have a he[Bb]art that's pu[F]re
Befo[Gm]re you[Eb]      [Bb]      [F]
Befo[Gm]re you[Eb]      [Bb]      [F]

Oh Lord, forg[Gm]ive me [Eb]      [Bb]
I ne[F]ed your me[Gm]rcy
