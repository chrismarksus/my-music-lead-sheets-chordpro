{title: Sweet Wind}
[D]There's a wi[Dsus]nd a-blow[D]in', all acr[Dsus]oss the l[D]and
[D]A fragrant [Dsus]breeze of he[D]aven, blowin' [Dsus]once a[D]gain

[G]Don't know wh[C]ere it [G]comes from, don't know wh[C]ere it go[G]es
[G]But let it blow over [D]me
[A]Oh, oh, oh, sweet [G]wind
Come and blow over [D]me

There's a rain a-pourin', showers from above
Mercy drops are comin', mercy drops of love

Turn your face to heaven, let the water pour
Well let it pour over me
Oh, oh, oh, sweet rain
Come and pour over me

There's a fire burning, falling from the sky
Awesome tongues of fire, consuming you and I

Can you feel it burnin', burn the sacrifice
Well let it burn over me
Oh, oh, oh, sweet fire
Come and burn over me
