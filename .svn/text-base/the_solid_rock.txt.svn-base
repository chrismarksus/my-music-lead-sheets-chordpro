{t:The Solid Rock}
My [E]hope is built on [B]nothing less
[E]Than [A]Jesus' blood and [B]righteous[E]ness;
I dare not trust the [B]sweetest frame,
[E]But [A]wholly lean on [B]Jesus' [E]name.

{soc}
[E]On Christ, [B/F#]the [E/G#]solid [A]rock I stand;
All [E]other ground is sinking [B]sand,
All [E]other [A]ground is [B]sinking [E]sand.
{eoc}

When darkness veils His loveley face,
I rest on His unchanging grace.
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
O may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.
