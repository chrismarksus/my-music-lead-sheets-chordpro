{t:Joy to the World}
[D]Joy to the world, the Lord [A]is [D]come!
Let [G]earth re[A]ceive her [D]King;
Let ev'[G]ry [D]heart prepare [G]him [D]room,
And heav'n and nature sing,
And [A]heav'n and nature [A7]sing,
And [D]heav'n, and heav'n and [D]na - [A7]ture [D]sing.

Joy to the world, the Saviour reigns,
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sin and sorrow grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make his blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness,
And wonders of his love,
And wonders of his love,
And wonders, wonders of his love.
