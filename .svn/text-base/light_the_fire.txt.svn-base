{title:Light the Fire}
I [G]stand to [D]praise You
But I [C]fall on my [G]knees
My [G]spirit is [D]willing
But my [C]flesh is so [D]weak

{soc}
Light the [Am7]fire (light the fire)
In my [D]soul (in my weary soul)
Fan the f[Am7]lame (fan the flame)
Make me w[D]hole (make my spirit whole)
Lord, You k[Am7]now (Lord, You know)
Just where I've [D]been (where I've been)
So light the [C]fire in my [D]heart [G]again
{eoc}

I feel Your arms around me
As the power of Your healing begins
Your spirit moves through me
(You breathe new life right through me?)
Like a mighty rushing wind

{soc}
Light the [Am7]fire (light the fire)
In my [D]soul (in my weary soul)
Fan the f[Am7]lame (fan the flame)
Make me w[D]hole (make my spirit whole)
Lord, You k[Am7]now (Lord, You know)
Just where I've [D]been (where I've been)
So light the [C]fire in my [D]heart [Em7]again
Light the [C]fire in my [D]heart [Em7]again
Light the [C]fire in my [D]heart [G]again
{eoc}
