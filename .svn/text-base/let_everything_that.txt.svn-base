[C#m7]Everything that h[A]as breath pr[A2/B]aise the Lord (2x)
{eoc}

[E]Praise you in the morning
[E/D#]Praise you in the evening
[C#m7]Praise you when I'm young and when I'm old[A2]
[E]Praise you when I'm laughing
[E/D#]Praise you when I'm grieving
[C#m7]Praise you every season of the soul

If w[F#m7]e (they) could see how m[E/G#]uch you're worth
Your p[F#m7]ow'r, Your might, Your en[E/G#]dless love
Then su[F#m7]rely we would ne[E/G#]ver cease to pr[A]aise 

Praise You in the heavens
Joining with the angels
Praising You forever and a day
Praise You on the earth now
Joining with creation
Calling all the nations to Your praise
