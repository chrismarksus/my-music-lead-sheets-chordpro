Here I am to [D/F#]worship
Here I am to [A/C#]bow down
Here I am to [D/F#]say that You're [D/G]my G[G]od
You're altogether [D]lovely

King of all days, oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

I'll [A]never [D]know how [G]much it cost
To [A]see my [D]sin up[G]on that cross
I'll [A]never [D]know how [G]much it cost
To [A]see my [D]sin up[G]on that cross
