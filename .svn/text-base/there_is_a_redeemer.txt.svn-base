Jesus my redeemer
Name above all names
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah
Oh for sinners slain

[D]Thank You [D/F#]oh my [G]Fa[D]ther
For [G]giving us [A]Your [D]Son[A]
And [D]leav[A]ing [D]Your [G]Spirit [D/F#]'till

When I stand in glory
I will see His face
And there I'll serve my King forever
In that holy place
