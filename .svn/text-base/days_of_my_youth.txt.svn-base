{t:Days of my Youth}
[G][Gsus][G][Gsus]
From the da[G]ys of my yo[Gsus]uth
You have be[G]en my strong tow[Gsus]er, oh Lo[G]rd [Gsus][G][Gsus]
I[G] run to y[Gsus]ou every mo[G]ment
Each ho[Gsus]ur, oh Lo[G]rd [Gsus][G][Gsus]

{soc}
From the da[C]ys of my youth, you have been wit[G]h me
From the da[C]ys of my youth, you have been wit[G]h me
From the d[D]ays of my youth
'Til my fra[C]me's worn and old, I'll love my Go[G]d
And I lon[D]g for the day when we me[C]et face to face
I love my Go[G]d
{eoc}

Be not far from me, Father
Come quickly, draw near me, oh God
As I call to the heavens
You're faithful to hear me, oh God
