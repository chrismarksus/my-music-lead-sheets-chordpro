Y[D]ou are my Rock of Re[C2]fuge
And [C7]You shelter me[G7]

In the d[C]arkest of nights
Through the storm[Em7]iest [Dsus]seas
The l[C]ight of Your love is a
Be[Em7]acon of sa[Dsus]fety to [C7sus]me
You shelter me[G7]

Jesus, You are a strong tower
My enemies flee
When I call on Your name
Yes, You are my Rock of Refuge
You shelter me
