{t:Blessed Be Your Name}
{gc:Capo 2nd fret}
[A] Blessed be[E] Your name in the [F#m7]land that is p[D]lentiful
Where Your [A]streams of a[E]bundance flow
Blessed[D] be Your name
[A] And blessed be[E] Your name when I'm [F#m7]found in the [D]desert place
Though I [A]walk through the [E]wilderness
Blessed[D] be Your name

[A] Every blessing [E]You pour out I'll
[F#m7] turn back to[D] praise
[A] And when the darkness[E] closes in, Lord
[F#m7] Still I will [D]say

{soc}
Blessed be the [A]name of the Lord[E]
Blessed be Your [F#m7]name[D]
Blessed be the [A]name of the Lord[E]
Blessed be Your [F#m7]glorious [D]name
{eoc}

Blessed be Your name when the sun's shining down on me
When the world's "all as it should be"
Blessed be Your name
And blessed be Your name on the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be Your name

{gc:Bridge:}
You [A]give and take a[E]way
You [F#m7]give and take a[D]way
My [A]heart will choose to [E]say
Lord, [F#m7]blessed be Your [D]name
