{title:Let It Burn}
[D]Let freedom fall
And [Dsus]break our chains
Let [D]freedom's fire
Come [Dsus]alive again

It's passions fire
The very flame of God
A Comsuming fire 
It's the power of love

With al[G]l our hearts
With all our minds
With all our strength
With all our souls
Let it B[D]urn

{soc}
L[D]et it burn, Let it [Dsus]burn
Let it [D]burn, Let it [Dsus]burn 
Let it [D]burn, Let it [Dsus]burn 
Let it [D]burn, Let it [Dsus]burn
Let it b[C]urn 
{eoc}
