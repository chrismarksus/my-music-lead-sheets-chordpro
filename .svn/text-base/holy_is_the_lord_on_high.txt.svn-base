{t:Holy Is the Lord on High}
In the [Em]stillness of this [D/E]hour
I [D]worship You my [A]Lord
Crying, [Cmaj7]"Holy [D]is the Lord on [Em]high"
In the [Em]quiet of my [D/E]heart
I [D]sing this song of [A]praise
Crying, [Cmaj7]"Holy [D]is the Lord on [Em7]high"

And for [Cmaj7]all of my [Bm7]days
I will [Em]bow down bef[D/E]ore You
Giving [Cmaj7]glory and [Bm7]honor to Your [Em]Name

And for [Cmaj7]all of my [Bm7]life
I will [Em]worship and a[D/E]dore You
Crying, [Cmaj7]"Holy [D]is the Lord on [Em]high"
