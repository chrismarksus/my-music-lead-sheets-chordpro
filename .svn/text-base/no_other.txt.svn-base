{t:No Other}
[G]There is no other friend
There is no other friend like [C]you, oh Lord
[D] No other brother, no other brother like you

[G]There is no other love
There is no other love like [C]you, oh Lord
[D] No other sweeter, no other fountain but you [G]

[Am7] How long until I'm [Em7]satisfied
[Am7] I must have more of [Em7]you
[Am7] For I was born in Zion 
[C] Awakened love is crying [D]out for you
It must be you

[G] And if I am healed by [C] just one touch of your [G]garment, Lord [D]
[G] Then how much more of your [C] love is for me than I'm [G]tasting, Lord [D]
[G] Draw me, [C] take me and [G]I will run [D]
[G] Over the mountains and down [C] into the valleys
I will [G]run with y[D]ou

[C]All, [Am] all my fountains are in y[G]ou
