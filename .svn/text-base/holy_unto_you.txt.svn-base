[F]Lord I come to [C]you, [Dm]with a humble [Bb]heart
[F]Seeking more of [C]you, wanting less of [Dm]me
Wanting more of [Bb]you
[F]From my deepest [C]parts, [Dm]God of mercy [Bb]hear
[F]Comes an urgent [C]prayer, that my heart's de[Dm]sire
Is to you draw [Bb]near[Bbsus4][Bb]

{soc}
Holy unto you, Holy unto you
Hear this hunble prayer and make me holy unto you
Ka-dosh ka-dosh l'cha, ka-dosh ka-dosh l'cha
Hear this humble prayer, make me ka-dosh ka-dosh l'cha
{eoc}

I give myself to you, on the altar lay
Spirit come and fill, so that I can more
Follow and obey
Let your light more shine, in this wounded heart
Clean and purify, so that I can more
Of yourself impart

{c:Joel Chernoff}
