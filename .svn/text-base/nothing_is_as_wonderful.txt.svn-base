[D]All I want is to kn[E]ow You, Jesus
[Dmaj7]All I want is to k[E]now I belong to You
[D]Show me all of the t[E]hings that are worthless
[Dmaj7]That I thought were so v[E]aluable to You

{soc}
N[A]othing is as lovely
[E/A]Nothing is as worthy
[A2add6]Nothing is as wonderful[A]
As knowing Y[D]ou[E][Dmaj7][E]
{eoc}

All I want is to know You Jesus
And the power that raised You from the dead
Help me forget all the things that I've done
And set my heart on what lies ahead
