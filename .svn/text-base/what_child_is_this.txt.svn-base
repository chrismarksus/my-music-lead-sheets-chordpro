While she[Em]pherds wa[B]tch are k[Em]eeping?

Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian, fear, for sinners here
The silent word is pleading

So br[Em]ing him in[G]cense, go[D]ld, and my[Bm]rrh

The Ki[Em]ng of K[G]ings salva[D]tion b[Bm]rings
Let lo[Em]ving hea[B]rts enth[Em]rone him
