{t:Faithful God}
[Bm][A][G]
[Bm]In the darkest ni[G]ght, when the sun doesn't sh[D2/F#]ine
In the dark night of my so[A]ul
[Bm]I hear you call my na[G]me
I see you walk in the ra[D2/F#]in
And I know you're in cont[A]rol

[D2/F#]You know the depth of my deepest si[G]n
Yet you call me as your fr[Bm]iend
You gave your ve[D2]ry be[G]st to m[A]e

{soc}
[D]Every morning I seek your fa[D][C#][Bm]ce
[Bm]Every evening I feel your grace
You are my fir[G]st love, you are my fa[A]ithful God
[D]Every day is a brand new da[D][C#][Bm]y
[Bm]I see your face as you look my way
You are my fi[G]rst love, you are my fai[A]thful God
{eoc}

When the strong winds blow
Lord, I feel so alone
The waves of life crash over me
I bow my head to you
Lord, I know your word is true
You are the truth who sets me free
