{t:You Are the One I Love}
[E]I am Yours completely
Y[A]ou are the One I l[E]ove
[E]There is no other
I treasure like You
Y[A]ou are the One I l[E]ove

And Y[A]ou are my joy
You are the light in my e[E]yes
And Y[A]ou cause my heart to sing
You're the One I l[E]ove
Jesus, Jesus You're the One I love
