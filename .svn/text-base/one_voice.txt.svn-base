Let us be [D]one [A]voice that [G]glorifies Your [A]name.
Let us be [D]one [A]voice de[G]claring that You [A]reign.
Let us be [Bm]one [F#m]voice in [Bm]love and harmo[Gm]ny,
And we [Em]pray O God, [G]grant us uni - [A]ty.[D]

Now is the time for you and I,
To join our hearts in praise.
That the name of Jesus,
Will be lifted high above the earth.
Then the world will know,
That Jesus Christ is Lord.
