{title:I Will Offer Up My Life}
[Em][D/F#][G]
[D]I will offer up my l[G]ife in sp[A]irit and tr[D]uth
Pouring out the oil of l[G]ove as my wor[A]ship to Y[D]ou
In surrender I must g[G]ive my ev[A]ery p[Bm7]art
Lord, receive the sacri[G]fice of a br[A]oken he[D]art

{soc}
Jesus what can I g[G]ive, wh[A]at can I br[D]ing
To so faithful a fr[G]iend, to so lo[A]ving a K[D]ing?
Savior what can be sa[G]id, wh[A]at can be s[D]ung
As a praise of Your na[G]me for the th[A]ings You have do[D]ne?
O my words could not te[Em]ll, not ev[D/F#]en in pa[G]rt
Of the de[Em]bt of lo[D/F#]ve that is o[G]wed by th[A]is thankful he[D]art
{eoc}

You deserve my every breath for You've paid the great cost
Giving up Your life to death, even death on a cross
You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin
Opened up the gates of heaven and have beckoned me in

What can I give, what can I bring,
What can I sing as an offering?
