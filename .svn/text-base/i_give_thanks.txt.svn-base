{title:I Give Thanks}
{subtitle:Psalm 30}
[G]You have [G/B]shown me [C]favor un[D]ending
[G]You have [G/B]given Your [C]life for [D]me
[G]And my [G/B]heart  [C]knows of Your [D]goodness
[Em]   Your [C]blood has covered [D]me

{start_of_chorus}
I(We) will a[G]rise and give [D]thanks to You
[C]Lord, my(our) God[D]
And Your [G]name I(we) will [D]bless
With [C]my(our) whole he[D]art
[G]   You have shown [D]mercy
[C]   You have shown [D]mercy to me[C](us)
[Am7] I(We) [G/B]give   [C]thanks [D]to You, Lord [G]
{end_of_chorus}

You have poured out Your healing upon us
You have set the captives free
And we know it's not what we've done
But by Your hand alone

{guitar_comment:Bridge:}
[Am7]   You, oh [G/B]Lord, are the [C]Healer of our [D]souls
[Am7]   You, oh [G/B]Lord, are the [C]Gracious Redeemer
You [Bm7]come to re[Am7]store us a[D]gain
Yes, You [Bm7]come to re[Am7]store us a[D]gain, and again[G]
