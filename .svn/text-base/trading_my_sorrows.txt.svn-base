{gc:Intro:}
[A][D][F#m][Esus4][E]

[A]I'm [D]trading my [F#m]sor[Esus4]rows,[E]
I'm trading my shame.
[A]I'm [D]laying them [F#m]down for the [E]joy of the Lord[A][D][F#m][Esus4][E]
I'm trading my sickness,
I'm trading my pain,
I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord.

{soc}
[A]Yes, Lord, [D]yes, Lord. [F#m]Yes, yes, [Esus4]Lord.[E]
Yes, Lord, yes, Lord. Yes, yes, Lord.
Yes, Lord, yes, Lord. Yes, yes, Lord. Amen! 
{eoc}

I am pressed but not crushed,
Persecuted not abandoned,
Struck down but not destroyed.
I am blessed beyond the curse,
For His promise will endure
That His joy's gonna be my strength.

{gc:Bridge:}
[E] Though the sorrow may [A/E]last for the [E]night,
His [Gadd9]joy comes with the morning.
