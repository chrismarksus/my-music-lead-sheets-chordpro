{t:Blessed Is the King}
{su:The Triumphal Entry Song}
[F]Jesus we worship You
We [Gm+4]lay our lives before You
And we [F/A]proclaim
Your [Bb9]kingdom has [Csus]come to us to[C]day

We praise You for Your mighty works
With all that is within us
If we do not lift our voices
The stones will surely shout

{soc}
[Dm]Blessed is the [Bb]King
Who [F]comes in the na[C]me of the [Dm]Lord!
The Son of [Bm]David!
Ho[F]sanna in the hi[C]ghest!
{eoc}

You triumphed over sin and death
To bring the world salvation
And You reign, exalted
With power forevermore

And as we lift our hands to You
We say with a united voice
That only You, the Risen Lord
Are worthy to be praised
