{t:Create in Me a Clean Heart}
{su:Psalm 51:10-12}
Cre[G]ate in me a [D]clean hea[C]rt, O [G]God
[C] And renew a right [D]spirit within [G]me
Cre[G]ate in me a [D]clean hea[C]rt, O [G]God
[C] And renew a right [D]spirit within [G]me

[C]Cast me not a[D]way
From Thy [G]presence, O [Em]Lord
And [C]take not Thy [D]Holy Spirit from [G]me
Re[C]store unto [D]me
The [B/D#]joy of [B/D#]Thy sal[Em]vation
[C]And renew a right [D]spirit within [G]me
