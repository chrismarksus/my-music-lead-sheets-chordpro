{t:Army of God}
{su:Joel 2:2}
[E] We are the army of God, [A] sons of Abraham
[F#m7] We are a [Bsus]chosen [B]gener[E]ation
[E] Under a covenant, [A] washed by His precious blood
[F#m7] Filled with the [Bsus]mighty [B]Holy [E]Ghost

And I [A]hear the [E]sound of the [A]coming [E]rain
As we [A]sing the [E]praise to the [F#m7]Great I [Bsus]Am[B]
And the [A]sick are [E]healed, and the [A]dead will [E]rise
As your [A]church [G#m]is the [F#m7]army that was [Bsus]prophesied [B]

[E] Your [A/E]church [E]is the [A/E]ar[E]my
