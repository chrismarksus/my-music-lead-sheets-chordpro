{t:Make Us a Prayer}
[A]Make me a [F#m7]prayer, let my [D]prayers be a [A]cry
Humble my [F#m7]heart so that [D]you may draw [A]nigh
[D]Cause me to [E]stand and cry [F#m7]out for this [D]land
Cause me to [E]be [F#m7]one who's set [D]free
To stand as a [E]house of [A]prayer

[A]Make us a [F#m7]prayer, let our [D]prayers be a [A]cry
Humble our [F#m7]hearts so that [D]you may draw [A]nigh
[D]Cause us to [E]stand and cry [F#m7]out for this [D]land
Cause us to [E]be a [F#m7]people set [D]free
Who stand as a [E]house of [A]prayer
