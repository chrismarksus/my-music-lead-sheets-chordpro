{title:His Banner Over Me}
{subtitle:Song of Songs 2:4}
He [G]brought me to His banqueting table
{comment:(echo) (2x)}
And His [C]banner over me is [G]love
[G]I am my Beloved's and He is mine
{comment:(echo) (2x)}
And His [C]banner over me is [G]love
Yes, His [C]banner over me is [G]love [Am7][G/B][C2][G][Am7][G/B][C2]

And we can [G]feel the love of Go[Am7]d in this place
We be[G/B]lieve Your goodness, we re[C2]ceive Your grace
We de[G]light ourselves at Your [Am7]table, oh God
You do [G/B]all things well, just [C2]look at our lives

His [G]banner over you, his [Am7]banner over me
His [G/B]banner over us is [C]love [G/B]love [Am7]love
