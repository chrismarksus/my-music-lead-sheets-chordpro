{soc}
And I will da[G]nce with all my heart, da[C]nce with all my soul

I will da[G]nce with my all my heart, da[C]nce in jubilee
[G]Dance with all my soul, c[D]ome Lord dance with me
{eoc}

I'll dance and praise your name for you defeated shame
You have torn my chains and I am clean again
I will dance with all my heart, dance with all my soul
Dance with all my strength for you have made me whole

When I ponder the cross, I count all things as lost
Lord you are my desire, your love holy fire
For I am clean, your blood has set me free
