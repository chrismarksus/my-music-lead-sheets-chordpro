{t:Another Drink}

I'm [E]thirsty, [C#m]Lord [A][B]
Yes, I'm [E]thirsty [C#m]Lord [A][B]
I'm [E]thirsty [C#m]Lord
For the [A]Living Wa[B]ters of Life[E][C#m][A][B]

And I want a drink
Yes, I want a drink
Well, I want a drink
Of the Living Waters of Life

[A]Fill me up Lord
[B]I don't have to feel it
[A]Make me drunk with your [B]Holy Spirit

And I'll take a drink
I'll take a drink
I'll take a drink
Of the Living Waters of Life

Fill me up Lord
I don't have to feel it
Lord, make me drunk with your Holy Spirit
I'm tired of whisperin'
I'll start to shoutin'
I don't want a cup, Lord
Give me Your fountain
I'll take another drink
I'll take another drink
I'll take another drink
Of the Living Waters of Life
