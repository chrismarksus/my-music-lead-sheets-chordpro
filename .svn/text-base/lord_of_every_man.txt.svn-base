[A][E/G#][F#7]
Oh Lord a[E]rise, release Your [B]pow'r
Scatter Your [F#m7]foes this very[C#m7] hour
May we hold [A]on to Your holy comma[E]nds
You are the [B]Lord of ev'ry man[A]

You hold our [E]lives, You give us [B]breath
You freed us [F#m7]from the power of[C#m7] death
You're our sal[A]vation, our onl[E]y hope
You are the [B]Lord of ev'ry man[A]

{start_of_chorus}
Your [E]voice, it is like [A]thunder over the wa[B]ters
Your [E]voice echoes through[A]out the Earth
We will bo[B]w to the sound
We will bow to the sound of You[E]r voice
{end_of_chorus}
