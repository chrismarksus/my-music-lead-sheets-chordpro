{t:Your Everlasting Love}
Your everlasting love is higher,
higher, higher than the sky
Your everlasting love is higher,
higher, higher than the sky
Higher than the sky
All the wonder of
Your everlasting love
Is higher than the sky

Your everlasting love is deeper,
deeper, deeper than the sea
Your everlasting love is deeper,
deeper, deeper than the sea
Deeper than the sea
All the wonder of
Your everlasting love
Is deeper than the sea

Higher than the heavens above
Is the glory of your wonderful love
I'm lost in the mystery of
Your everlasting love
Your everlasting love
Your everlasting love

Your everlasting love is reaching,
reaching, reaching out to me
Your everlasting love is reaching,
reaching, reaching out to me
Reaching out to me
All the wonder of
Your everlasting love
Is reaching out to me
