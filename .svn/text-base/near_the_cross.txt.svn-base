{t:Near the Cross}
Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain
Free to all, a healing stream
Flows from Calvary's mountain.
{soc}
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
{eoc}

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the bright and morning star
Sheds its beams around me.
{soc}
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
{eoc}

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me.
{soc}
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
{eoc}

Near the cross I'll watch and wait
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.
{soc}
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
{eoc}
