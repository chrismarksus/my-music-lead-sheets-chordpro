{t:We Will Dance}
[D]Sing a song of celebration, lift up a shout of praise
For the Bridegroom will [G2]come, the glorious [D]one
And [C2]oh, [G2]we will look on His [D]face
We'll [C2]go [G2]to a much better [D]place

[D]Dance with all your might, lift up your hands and clap for joy
The time's drawing [G2]near when He will [D]appear
And [C2]oh, [G2]we will stand by His [D]side
A [C2]strong, [G2]pure, spotless [Asus]bride[A]

{soc}
[D]We will [C]dance on the [G]streets that are [D]golden
The glorious [C]bride and the [G]great Son of [D]Man
From every [C]tongue and [G]tribe and [D]nation
Will [C]join[G] in the song of the [D]Lamb
{eoc}

[D]Sing aloud, for the time of rejoicing is near (echo)
The risen King, our groom, is soon to appear (echo)
The wedding feast to come is now near at hand (echo)
Lift up your voice, proclaim the coming Lamb (echo)
