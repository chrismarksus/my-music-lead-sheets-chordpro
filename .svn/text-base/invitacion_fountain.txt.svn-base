[Em]On the rivers of [C]heartache
[G]Come to the [C]sea,
[Em]Come on, and [C]be set free!

If You [G]lead me Lord, I will [C]follow

Let all who are weak
All who are weary
Come to the Rock
Come to the Fountain
Let all who have climbed
The mountains of heartbreak
Reach to the sky
Come on, and give your life
