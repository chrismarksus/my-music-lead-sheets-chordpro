{t:Lord, Reign in Me}
[C]Over [G]all the ea[F]rth, you r[G]eign on [C]high
Every m[G]ountain stre[F]am, every s[G]unset sk[Am7]y
But my [G]one requ[F]est, Lord, my [G]only ai[Dm7]m
Is that you'd [F]reign in [G]me again

{soc}
[C]Lord, [G]reign in m[F]e, reign i[G]n your pow[C]er
Over a[G]ll my dre[F]ams, in my [G]darkest ho[Am7]ur
You a[G]re the Lo[F]rd of [G]all I a[Dm7]m
So won't you [F]reign in [G]me agai[C]n[G][F][Am7][G][F]
{eoc}

Over every thought, over every word
May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord
'Cause you mean more to me than any earthly thing
So won't you reign in me again
