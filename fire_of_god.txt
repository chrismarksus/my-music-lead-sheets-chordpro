{t:Lamb of God}
[C]Your only Son, no sin to hide
But You [G/B]have [Am]sent Him from Your [Gsus4]side [G]
To [C/E]walk up[Am]on this guilty [Fmaj7]sod
And to be[C/G]come the Lamb [G]of [C]God

{soc}
O Lamb [G/B]of [Am]God, sweet Lamb of [C]God
I love the [Am]holy Lamb of [Gsus4]God [G]
O [C/E]wash me [Am]in Your [Em]precious [Fmaj7]blood
My Jesus [C/G]Christ the [Gsus4]Lamb [G]of [C]God
{eoc}

Your gift of love they crucified
They laughed and scorned Him as He died
The humble King they named a fraud
And sacrificed the Lamb of God

I was so lost, I should have died
But You have brought me to Your side
To be led by Your staff and rod
And to be called a lamb of God
