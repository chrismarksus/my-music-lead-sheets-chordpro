{c:Verse 1}
Wh[D]en the music fa[A]des, all is stripped a[Em]way, and I simply [A7sus4]come;
Lo[D]nging just to br[A]ing, something that's of wo[Em]rth
That will bless your [A7sus4]heart.

{c:Verse 2}
I'll [Em]bring you mor[D/F#]e than a s[A]ong,
For a song in its[Em]elf is not wha[D/F#]t You have required[A]     [A/C#]       [D]
You[Em] search much d[D/F#]eeper withi[A]n
Through the way things appe[Em]ar;
You're looking in[D/F#]to my heart[A]

{c:Chorus}
{soc}
I'[D]m coming back to the heart o[A2/C#]f worship
And it's all ab[Em]out You, i[G]ts all about Y[A]ou, Jesu[D]s
I'm [D]sorry Lord for the thing [A2/C#]I've made it,
When it's a[Em]ll about You, al[G]l about Y[A]ou, Jes[D]us
{eoc}

{c:Verse 3}
Ki[D]ng of endless wo[A]rth, no one could expres[Em]s, how much You de[A7sus4]serve;
Th[D]ough I'm weak and [A]poor, all I have is Y[Em]ours, every single br[A7sus4]eath
I'll[Em] bring you mo[D/F#]re than a so[A]ng.
For a song in it[Em]self is not what[D/F#] You have require[A]d   [A/C#]        [D]
Yo[Em]u search much de[D/F#]eper withi[A]n
Through the way things appea[Em]r;
You're looking in[D/F#]to my heart[A]

{c: Sing each line then repeat line softly}
I'll [Em]bring you mor[D/F#]e than a s[A]ong,
I'll [Em]bring you mor[D/F#]e than a s[A]ong,
You're looking in[D/F#]to my heart[A]
You're looking in[D/F#]to my heart[A]
