{t:I Remember}
Oh how sweet is the blood of Jesus
That was poured out for me
Oh how lovely is the face beaten for me
Oh how sweet, is the blood of the Lamb

For the life You gave I could never repay 
The precious blood poured out for me

I remember Your body
I remember Your blood
I remember You died for me
I remember Your love for me
Your sweet, precious love.
