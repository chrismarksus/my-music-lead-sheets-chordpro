{t:Theyll Know We Are Christians}
{st:Jars Of Clay}

We are [Em]one in the Spirit we are one in the Lord
We are o[Am]ne in the Spirit we are o[Em]ne in the Lord
And we p[Am]ray that all unity may o[Em]ne day be restored
And they'll kn[C]ow we are christians by our l[Em]ove by our l[Am]ove
and they'll k[Em]now we are chri[Am]stians by our l[Em]ove

{gc:I don't know the bridge but i think its the same chords}
{gc:the rest of the verses are the same Em Am C stuff. Real easy song}
