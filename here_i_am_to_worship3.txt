[D]Light of the [Asus4]world
You stepped [Em7]down into darkness
[D]Opened my [Asus4]eyes let me se[D/G]e
[D]Beauty that [Asus4]made this hea[Em7]rt adore You
[D]Hope of a [Asus4]life spent with [D/G]You[Gsus2]

{soc}
Here I am to [D/F#]worship
Here I am to [A/C#]bow down
Here I am to [D/F#]say that You're [D/G]my G[G]od
You're altogether [D]lovely
Altogether [A/C#]worthy
Altogether [D/F#]wonderful t[D/G]o me[G]
{eoc}

King of all days, oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

{c:Chorus}

I'll [A]never [D]know how [G]much it cost
To [A]see my [D]sin up[G]on that cross
I'll [A]never [D]know how [G]much it cost
To [A]see my [D]sin up[G]on that cross
