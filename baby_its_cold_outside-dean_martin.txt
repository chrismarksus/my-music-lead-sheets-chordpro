{t:Baby Its Cold Outside-Dean Martin}
{st:Dean Martin}

I [F]really can't [F7]stay
But baby it's cold outside
I've [Gm7]got to go [C7]'way
But baby it's cold outside
This [F]evening has [F7]been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very [Cm7]nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My [Bb]mother will start to worry
Beautiful words you're humming
And [Bb7]father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So [F]really I'd better [Dm7]scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, [G7]maybe just a half a drink [C7]more
Put some records on while I pour

The [F]neighbors might [F7]think
But baby it's bad out there
Say, [Gm7]what's in this [C7]drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I [F]wish I knew [F7]how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the [Cm7]spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I [Bb]ought to say no, no, no sir
Mind if I move in closer?
At [Bb7]least I'm gonna say that I [C7]tried
What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?
I [F]really can't [F7]stay
Oh baby don't hold out
Ah but it's [G7]cold [C7]out[F]side
Baby it's cold outside

I [F]simply must [F7]go
But baby it's cold outside
The [Gm7]answer is [C7]no
But baby it's cold outside
The [F]welcome has [F7]been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and [Cm7]warm
Look out that window at that storm

My [Bb]sister will be suspicious
Gosh your lips look delicious
My [Bb7]brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My [F]maiden aunt's mind is [Dm7]vicious
Gosh your lips are delicious
Well, [G7]maybe just a cigarette [C7]more
Never such a blizzard before

I've [F]got to get [F7]home
But baby you'd freeze out there
Say, [Gm7]lend me a [C7]coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've [F]really been [F7]grand
I'm thrilled when you touch my hand
Why don't you [Cm7]see
How can you do this thing to me?


There's [Bb]bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At [Bb7]least there will be plenty im[C7]plied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I [F]really can't [F7]stay
Get over that hold-out
Ah but it's [G7]cold [C7]out[F]side
Ah but it's cold outside

Baby it's [G7]cold, [C7]cold out[F]side
