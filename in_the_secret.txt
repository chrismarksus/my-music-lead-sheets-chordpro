[G] In the secret, in the quiet pla[C]ce

[G] In the secret
 In the quiet[C] hour I wait only for you
[Em] 'Cause I want to k[D]now you m[C]ore

[G] I want to [D]know you
[Em] I want to [C]hear your voice
[G] I want to [D]know you [C]more
[G] I want to [D]touch you
[Em] I want to [C]see your face
[G] I want to [D]know you [C]more

 I am reaching for the highest goal
 That I might receive the prize
 Pressing onward
 Pushing every hinderance aside, out of my way
 'Cause I want to know you more
