{t:It Is Well With My Soul}
When [C]peace, like a [G]river, at[Dm]ten[G]deth my [C]way,
When [Am]sorrows like [D]sea billows [G]roll;
What[C]ever my [F]lot, thou hast [D]taught me to [G]say,
It is [C]well, it [F]is [G]well with my [C]soul.

{soc}
It is [C]well (it is [G]well)
With my [G]soul (with my [C]soul)
It is [F]well, it is [G]well with my [C]soul.
{eoc}

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.
{c:(refrain)}

My sin--oh, the joy of this glorious thought--
My sin, not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
{c:(refrain)}

And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.
{c:(refrain)}
