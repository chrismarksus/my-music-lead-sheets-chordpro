{t:Shout to the North}
Men of [G]faith rise [D]up and [C]sing
Of the [G]great and [D]glorious [C]King
You are [G]strong when [D]you feel [C]weak
In your [G]broken[D]ness com[C]plete

{soc}
[G]Shout to the [C]North and the [D]South
[G]Sing to the [C]East and the [D]West
[Em]Jesus is [C]saviour to [D]all
[C]Lord of [D]heaven and [G]earth
{eoc}

Rise up women of the truth
Stand and sing to broken hearts
Who can know the healing power
Of our awesome King of love

{c:Chorus}

[Em]We've been through fire, [C]we've been through rain
[Em]We've been refined by the po[C]wer of his name
[Em]We've fallen deeper i[C]n love with you
You've burned the truth on our l[D]ips

{c:Chorus}

Rise up church with broken wings
Fill this place with songs again
Of our God who reigns on high
By his grace again we'll fly

{c:Chorus}
