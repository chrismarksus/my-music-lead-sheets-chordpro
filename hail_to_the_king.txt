{title:Hail To The King}
You [A]came to us a man
In [F#m11]very nature God
[Dmaj7]Pierced for our iniquities
As You [Esus]hung upon the [E]cross
But [A]God exalted You
[F#m11]To the highest place
And [Dmaj7]gave to You the right to bear
The [Esus]Name above all nam[E]es
That [D]at the Name of [Esus]Jesus[E] we should [F#m11]bow[E]
And [D]every tongue con[C#7/F]fess that You are [F#m11]Lord
And [D]when You come in glory[E] for the [F#m7]world [E]to [D]see
We will [Esus]sing...[E]

{start_of_chorus}
[A]Hail to the [D]King[A/C#]
In [Bm7]all his [A]splendor and [Esus]majesty[E]
[F#m7]Hail [E]to the [D]King [A/C#]of [Bm7]Kings
Lord [A]Je[D]sus, [E]our [A]God
{end_of_chorus}

We eagerly await the coming of the day
When the glory of the risen King will shine upon the earth
Then rival thrones will fall before the Lord of all
And hail supreme authority in the true and living God
At the Name of Jesus we will bow
As every tongue confesses You as Lord
When You come in glory for the world to see
We will sing...
