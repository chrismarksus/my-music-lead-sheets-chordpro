O Lord [Am]God[C], to whom [Am]vengeance be[G]longs
O [Am]God[C], to whom [Am]vengeance be[G]longs
Shine for[F]th     [F]        [Em]          [Dm7]

And rise up, O King of the earth
Lord rise up, O Klng of the earth
Shine forth

[Dm7]How long will the [Em7]wicked triu[Am]mph?[C]        [Am]          [C]
[Dm7]How long will the [Em7]wicked triu[Am]mph?[C]        [Am]          [C]


Bles'd is the [G]man whom [F]You [Em]instr[Dm7]uct
Oh [G]Lord, and teach [F]of [Em]Your [Dm7]law
That You [G]may give him rest in his [F]day of trouble
That You [G]may give him rest in his [F]day of adversit[E]y

[Am]In my many tro[C]ubles Your [G]comfort de[Fmaj7]lights my [Gmaj7]soul
