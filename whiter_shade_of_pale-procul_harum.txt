{c:VERSE 1}
[C]We skipped the light fan-[Am]dango
[F]and turned cartwheels across the [Dm]floor
[G]I was feeling kind of [Em]seasick  [G7]
[C]but the crowd called out for [Am]more.  [Em]
[F]The room was humming [Dm]harder
[G]as the ceiling flew a-[Em]way . .  [G7]
[C]When we called out for a-[Am]nother drink  [Em]
[F]the waiter brought a [Dm]tray

{c:CHORUS}
{soc}
[G]And so it [C]was that [Am]later
[F]as the miller told his [Dm]tale
[G]that her face at first just [Em]ghostly
[G7]turned a [C]whiter [F]shade of [C]pale.  [G7]
{eoc}

{c:VERSE 2}
[C]She said, 'There is no [Am]reason,  
[F]and the truth is plain to [Dm]see.'
[G7]But I wandered through my [Em]playing cards  [G7]
[C]and would not let her [Am]be . . [Em]
[F]One of sixteen vestal [Dm]virgins
[G7]who were leaving for the [Em]coast  [G7]
[C]and although my eyes were [Am]open  [Em]
[F]they might just as well have been [Dm]closed

{c:REPEAT CHORUS}

{c:VERSE 3}
[C]She said, 'I'm home on [Am]shore leave,'
[F]though in truth we were at [Dm]sea
[G7]so I took her by the [Em]looking glass  [G7]
[C]and forced her to a-[Am]gree.  [Em]
[F]Saying, 'You must be the [Dm]mermaid
[G7]who took Neptuen for a [Em]ride.'  [G7]
[C]But she smiled at me so [Am]sadly  [Em]
[F]that my anger straightway [Dm]died.

{c:REPEAT CHORUS}

{c:VERSE 4}
[C]If music be the [Am]food of love
[F]then laughter is its [Dm]queen
[G7]and likewise if be-[Em]hind is in front  [G7]
[C]then dirt in truth is [Am]clean.  [Em]
[F]My mouth by then like [Dm]cardboard
[G7]seemed to slip straight through my [Em]head.  [G7]
[C]So we crash-dived straightway [Am]quickly  [Em]
[F]and attacked the ocean [Dm]bed.

{c:REPEAT CHORUS}
