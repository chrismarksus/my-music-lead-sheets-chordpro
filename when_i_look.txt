When I [C]look into Your holi[F]ness
When I [C]gaze into Your l[Em7]ovelin[F]ess

In the [Dm]light[Am] of Y[G7]ou[G]

When I've [C]found the joy of reaching Your h[F]eart
When my [C]will becomes e[Em7]nthroned in Your l[F]ove
[G7]When all [Em]things [C]that [Em]surround [C]become [F]shadows
In the [Dm]light[Am] of Y[G7]ou[G]

I worship[Fmaj7] You , [G] I worship Y[Em7]ou[Am]
The [Dm]reason I live [G]is to [F]wors[G]hip Y[Cmaj7]ou[Dm7][Em7]
[C]I [Dm7]wors[G]hip [Fmaj7]You , [G] I worship [Em7]You[Am]
The [Dm]reason I li[F]ve[G] is to [F]wors[G7]hip Y[C]ou
