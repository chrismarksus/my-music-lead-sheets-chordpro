[F#]She calls me Goliath and I w[E]ear the David mask
[B]I guess the stones are coming too f[F#]ast for her now
[F#]You know I'd like to believe this n[E]ervousness will pass
[B]All the stones that are thrown are b[F#]uilding up a wall
[F#]I have bec[A]ome cumbers[E]ome to this w[F#]orld
[F#]I have bec[A]ome cumbers[E]ome to my g[F#]irl

{c: VERSE 1}
I'd like to believe we could reconcile the past
Resurrect those bridges with an ancient glance
But my old stone face can't seem to break her down
She remembers bridges & burns them to the ground
I have become cumbersome to this world
I have become cumbersome to my girl

{c: CHORUS}
{soc}
[F#]Too heavy, too light, too black or too w[A]hite, too wrong or too right
Today or ton[E]ight...cumbers[F#]ome
[F#]Too rich or too poor, she's wanting me l[A]ess and I'm wanting her more
[E]The bitter taste is cumbers[F#]ome, no, yeah
[A]No, [A]no, [F#]no...[E][E][F#]
[A]No, [A]no, [F#]no, yeah[E][E][F#]

{c: VERSE 3}
[F#]There is a b[E]alance between two w[B]orlds
One with an [F#]arrow and a cross
[F#]Regardless of the b[E]alance
Life has bec[B]ome cumbers[F#]ome
Too heavy, too light...
N[A]ah, n[A]ah, [F#]No, no..[E].yeah-[F#]heah
Y[A]our l[F#]ife has become c[E]umbers[F#]ome
