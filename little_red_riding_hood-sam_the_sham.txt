{t:Little Red Riding Hood}
{st:Sam The Sham}


Pattern 1:
[Em]Hey there, Little Red [G]Riding Hood
[A] You sure are lookin' good
[C]You're everything a [B7]big bad wolf could [Em]want
[B7]  Listen to me!

(in pattern 1):
Little Red Riding Hood
I don't think little big girls should
Go walkin' in these spooky old woods alone
Owwww!

Pattern 2:
[G] What big eyes you have
[Em]  The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad
So [A]just to see that you don't get chased
I think I [D7]ought to walk with you for a ways

(in pattern 2):
What cool lips you have
They're sure to lure someone bad
So until you get to Grandma's place
I think you ought to walk with me and be safe

(in pattern 1):
I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on
Till I'm sure that you've been shown
That I can be trusted walkin' with you alone
Owwww!

(in pattern 1):
Little Red Riding Hood,
I'd like to hold you if I could
But you might think I'm a big bad wolf, so I won't
Owwww!

(in pattern 2):
What a big heart I have
The better to love you with
Little Red Riding Hood
Even bad wolves can be good

(in pattern 2):
I'll try to be satisfied
Just to walk close by your side
Maybe you'll see things my way
Before we get to Grandma's place

(in pattern 1):
Little Red Riding Hood
You sure are lookin' good
You're everything a big bad wolf could want
[B7]Owwww--I mean [Em]baaa!    [G]        [A]Baaaa!
...and fade
